## Jets Project

### Week 2 Homework for Skill Distillery


#### Description

This program has an abstract SuperClass of Jets. The subclasses will be a CargoJet, FighterJet, and a PlainJet. It will also have two interfaces, one for CargoCarrier, and the other for CombatReady. The Jets will all have fields of model, speed, range, and price. 

#### How To Use
* User can select from menu options 1-8
* Once the user makes a selection, it will display what is listed on the menu
* Menu option one lists all jets in the Air Field
* Menu option two allows users to fly all Jets
* Menu option three allows users to view the fastest jet in stock
* Menu option four allows users to view the jet with the longest range in stock
* Menu option five allows users to load all cargo jets, but is not yet available
* Menu option six lets users fight all fighter jets, but is not yet available
* Menu option seven lets users input their own jets
* Menu option eight lets users exit the program
* Users can then choose to go back to the main menu or exit from there


#### Lessons Learned
* When creating a new array, you only need to instantiate it once
* When checking for speed and range, set it to the object, then use the get method to get the fastest and longest range one
* When letting users add new jets, it needs to be inputed into the current array
